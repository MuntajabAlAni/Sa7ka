# Sa7ka

**Sa7ka** is a simple Windows application that allows you to use hotkeys (Ctrl + F2 or F3) to capture the text that the user is typing in a wrong language selected (and another language wanted) from AR and EN only.
and convert it to the correct language depending on the captured hotkey. Itâ€™s designed to make it easier to fix typos and annoying required changes for language when typing some stuff.

## Features

- **Global Hotkey Support**: Use hotkeys (like Ctrl+F2) to capture clipboard content from anywhere.
- **Clipboard Text Detection**: Automatically detect text copied to your clipboard and display it.
- **System Tray Integration**: Minimize the app to the system tray and easily interact with it via balloon notifications.
- **Arabic To English**: Ctrl+F3 will change the typed characters from Arabic language to Englsih 
- **English To Arabic**: Ctrl+F2 will change the typed characters from English language to Arabic
- **Automatically language change**: After killing the Sa7ka (Fix the typo), the app will automatically change the keyboard language to the targeted language to let you complete typing without any other needed actions.
- **Startup abiliity**: Can be added to startup path with one click so the app will run when you start your PC up.
